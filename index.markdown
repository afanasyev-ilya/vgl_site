VGL is a high-performance graph processing framework, designed for modern NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA vector architecture. NEC SX-Aurora TSUBASA is equipped with world
  highest memory bandwidth of 1.2-1.5 TB/s, which allows to significantly solving various graph problems.
  VGL provides simple computational and data abstractions, which allow to easily express many graph algorithms.

After downloading VGL, check [installation](./installation.html) instructions.

To get started, check VGL [BFS](./bfs_example.html) sample.

Check [documentation](./documentation.html)  to learn more about VGL computational and data abstractions.

Check [performance](./performance.html) to learn more about VGL performance compared to existing multicore CPU and NVIDIA 
GPU graph-processing frameworks and libraries.

If you use VGL, please [cite](./cite.html) our works.
